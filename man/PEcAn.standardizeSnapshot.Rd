\title{standardizeSnapshot is a R package to standardize camera trap records files from the Snapshot Safari project.}
\description{
Snapshot Safari data comes in different standards, 
following the method that was used to classify pictures 
(Zooniverse, TrapTagger or Digikam). This package allows to standardize 
all data sources to a unique file format and then cleans the files to 
homogenize records.
